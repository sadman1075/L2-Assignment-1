# TypeScript Face-Off: Interfaces vs Types – What’s the Difference and Why It Matters

An interface in TypeScript defines the structure of an object. It's typically used to type-check class instances and object shapes.  An interface is primarily used to define the shape of an object. It is most commonly applied when working with classes or describing the structure of objects that will be used consistently throughout a codebase. For example, an interface User might specify that any object of this type must have a name (a string) and an age (a number).

On the otherhand, A type alias creates a new name for any valid TypeScript type: object, union, primitive, or tuple. a type alias allows you to define any valid TypeScript type—this could be an object, a primitive, a union, a tuple, or even a function signature. Type aliases are more flexible and better suited to complex type combinations and transformations.

## Syntax and Structural Differences

Both interfaces and type aliases can be used to model object structures, and in simple scenarios, they are almost interchangeable. However, they differ in how they handle extension and composition. Interfaces are extended using the extends keyword, which allows one interface to build upon another, forming a hierarchy. This is very useful for object-oriented design and large codebases. In contrast, types are extended using intersection types, denoted with the & operator. While this is equally powerful, it’s syntactically different and slightly less intuitive in deeply nested cases.
A key distinction is that interfaces support declaration merging, which means multiple interface declarations with the same name are automatically combined into one. This is especially useful in open systems or library code where augmentation is common. Type aliases do not support declaration merging—redeclaring a type alias with the same name results in a compilation error. This makes interfaces more extensible in certain contexts, while types are more rigid but predictable.

## Advanced Capabilities of Type Aliases

One of the greatest strengths of type aliases is their flexibility. Type aliases can represent union types, such as a variable that can be either a string or a number, which interfaces cannot. They can also define tuples, where the type and length of the array are fixed, or primitive aliases, such as type ID = string | number. Furthermore, type aliases shine in advanced type manipulation. They can be used to create mapped types and conditional types, enabling developers to build complex transformations of existing types—something interfaces are not designed to handle.

For example, a type alias can be used to make all properties of another type readonly, or to create a new type based on a condition. These features are essential when writing generic utility types or designing flexible APIs. While interfaces support generics, they do not offer the same level of transformation capabilities. Therefore, when working with complex data types, transformations, or union logic, type aliases are the preferred tool.
