### TypeScript Face-Off: Interfaces vs Types – What’s the Difference and Why It Matters

An interface in TypeScript defines the structure of an object. It's typically used to type-check class instances and object shapes.  An interface is primarily used to define the shape of an object. It is most commonly applied when working with classes or describing the structure of objects that will be used consistently throughout a codebase. For example, an interface User might specify that any object of this type must have a name (a string) and an age (a number).
